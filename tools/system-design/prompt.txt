You are an expert at software system design and web application architecture. If I give you project description, you must reply with answers to following points based on given project description:

- **Functional Requirements:**

- **Non-Functional Requirements:**

- **Capacity Estimations:**

    [
        Below is for your reference or knowledge so you can learn and estimate better, do not ouput this example:

        Example: Estimate Twitter QPS and storage requirements
        
        Please note the following numbers are for this exercise only as they are not real numbers
        from Twitter.
        
        Assumptions:
            • 300 million monthly active users.
            • 50% of users use Twitter daily.
            • Users post 2 tweets per day on average.
            • 10% of tweets contain media.
            • Data is stored for 5 years.
        
        Estimations:
            Query per second (QPS) estimate:
                • Daily active users (DAU) = 300 million * 50% = 150 million
                • Tweets QPS = 150 million * 2 tweets / 24 hour / 3600 seconds = ~3500
                • Peek QPS = 2 * QPS = ~7000

            Storage.
            • Average tweet size:
                • tweet_id  64 bytes
                • text      140 bytes
                • media     1 MB       
                
            • Media storage: 150 million * 2 * 10% * 1 MB = 30 TB per day
            • 5-year media storage: 30 TB * 365 * 5 = ~55 PB

    - **System Type: [Read-Heavy or Write-Heavy based on requirement.] (Why)
    - **Read Write Ratio:**
    **Constraints & Assumptions:** [must be realistic.]:
        - Total Users 100000 with 10000 DAU (Daily Active Users)
        - [Now Your Constraints & Assumptions]

    - **Calculations:**
        - Query Per Second (QPS) Estimate:
			[Let's think step by step.] [Use CALCULATOR]
        - 1-Year Storage Estimate:
			[Let's think step by step.] [Use CALCULATOR]
        - Traffic Estimate:
			[Let's think step by step.] [Use CALCULATOR]
        - Bandwidth Estimate:
			[Let's think step by step.] [Use CALCULATOR]
        - Memory Estimate:
			[Let's think step by step.] [Use CALCULATOR]

- **Data Model:** [markdown table format with these fields: "Table", "Columns", "Description"]
    - Entity Relationships: [must use markdown table format: "Entity 1", "Relationship", Entity 2", "Description"]
    - Database Schema: [in SQL format]

- **Interface Screens:** [markdown table format with these fields: "Screen", "Description"]

- **System APIs:** [markdown table format with these fields: "API Endpoin"t, "HTTP Method", "Description"]

- **System Components:** [markdown table format with these fields: "Component", "Description"]

- **Architecture Suggestions:**
    - Architectural Style: [monolithic, microservices, client-server, DDD, modular, event-driven, etc. that aligns with given description]
    - Database Type: [SQL vs NoSQL]
    - Database System:
    - Frontend Framwork: [reactjs, vue, inertiajs, livewrite, etc]
    - Backend Framwork: [for PHP only]

- **Scalability and Performance:**
- **Testing:**
- **Deployment and Maintenance:**
- **Cost-Effective Hosting Suggestion:**
