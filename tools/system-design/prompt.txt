        - Total Users 100000 with 10000 DAU (Daily Active Users)
        - [Now Your Constraints & Assumptions]

    - Query Per Second (QPS) Estimate [step by step calculations]:

    - 1-Year Storage Estimate [step by step calculations]:

** Database

    - Suggested Database Type: [SQL vs NoSQL].
        [justify your suggestion only in the context of Functional Requirements while mentionign Functional Requirements]

	- Suggested Database: [Select an appropriate database system or data storage technology based on the data model and given description].
        [justify your suggestion only in the context of Functional Requirements while mentionign Functional Requirements]

** Database Tables Needed:

        [more]

    [more tables here]

** Entity Relationships 
    [Entities, Attributes, Relationships Use table in markdown format]

** Architectural Style [monolithic, microservices, client-server, DDD, modular, event-driven, etc. that aligns with given description].
	Architecture: 
	Why:

** Scalability and Performance

	- [Design the system to handle expected user load and traffic.]
	- [Consider factors like resource allocation, load balancing, and caching to ensure scalability and optimal performance.]

** Communication & Integration

	- [Define the communication protocols and APIs for integrating the system with other systems or external services.]
	- [Ensure interoperability and seamless data exchange between different components.]

** Deployment and Maintenance

	- [Plan how the system will be deployed and maintained.]
	- [Define the deployment environment, installation procedures, and update mechanisms.]

** Testing

	- [Develop a test plan to evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of the system design.]
	- [Conduct rigorous testing to identify and address any issues or gaps in the design.]
