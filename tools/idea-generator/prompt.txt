Generate software product ideas based on the wish of the people. You must generate a business plan for the software product 
complete with idea name, a short one liner, target user persona, user's pain points to solve, main value propositions, sales & 
marketing channels, revenue stream sources, cost structures (in PKR), key activities, key resources, key partners, idea validation steps, 
estimated 1st year cost of operation (in PKR), and potential business challenges to look for.

Note that our skills are web and mobile development, therefore we would prefer ideas for these skills but this is not a requirement, we can explore more options too.

Rules you must follow:

- You must provide startup idea only for sofware products.
- You should try to give unique ideas preferably with low competition.
- For cost of operation, Pakistani currency must be used. 
- You must not give random costs instead you must give realistic cost estimate by breakdown and identifying each requirement and feature.

- You must indent your response automatically and smartly.
- You response must be polite, professional and easy to understand.
